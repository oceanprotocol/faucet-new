### Faucet for OCEAN tokens on test networks

#### Getting started

```bash
# create .env from .env.example

# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start development server on browser
npm start
```

## âœ¨ Code Style

Code style is automatically enforced through [ESLint](https://eslint.org) & [Prettier](https://prettier.io) rules:

- Git pre-commit hook runs `prettier` on staged files, setup with [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky)
- VS Code suggested extensions and settings for auto-formatting on file save

For running linting and auto-formatting manually, you can use from the root of the project:

```bash
# linting check, also runs Typescript typings check
npm run lint

# auto format all files in the project with prettier, taking all configs into account
npm run format
```
